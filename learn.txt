According to me DevClub is a student club that is all about programming. Its basic aim is to provide basic computer programming knowledge.
May be its aim is to pace up the coding culture in IIT Delhi. This club is about technical activities and providing technical 
knowledge in fun and easy way to the seekers.
This club develops new technical ways which can help everyone inside the college.
